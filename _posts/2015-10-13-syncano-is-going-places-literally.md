Syncano has been publicly available for about two months now. As Principal Developer Evangelist, I couldn’t be more excited when I’m talking to other developers about the product and how it will help their building process. The developer evangelist’s role is no secret at any company; but, at Syncano, I wanted to make sure that we supported as many local communities as possible.  That is where the best conversations happen, and I truly enjoy talking to everyone I meet. The work being done for developers at a micro level is simply incredible and, if I can sponsor an event to help keep that going, that’s important to me -- and to all of us at Syncano.

##The Past

We kicked everything off with a trip to Nashville to speak on the [Music City Code](http://www.musiccitycode.com/) “Future of the Web” panel. This was the first year that organizer [Gaines Kergosien](https://twitter.com/gainesk) put on the event -- but I can tell you this conference felt like it had been around for years.  The event was superbly executed, thoughtfully organized, and will be around for years to come. They even let me get on stage and play a song with the band! Be on the lookout for next year’s conference -- it’s sure to be a blast.

September was action packed with [TechCrunch Disrupt](http://techcrunch.com/event-info/disrupt-sf-2015/), September 21-23, when we packed up and went to the West Coast to enjoy 3 crazy days of game-changing technology.  While this isn’t a local, community-driven event, they did have Snoop Dogg there, and that’s just hard to pass up!

Following TC, we sponsored [Dev Workshop Indy](http://conf.devworkshop.org/), in my neck of the woods. The two-day conference was organized by [Todd Shelton](https://twitter.com/tweenout) and [Scott Williams](https://twitter.com/scott_joe_will). The duo also hosts a [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Dev-Workshop-Indy/) in Indianapolis that focuses on instructional workshops directed towards improving the skills of developers.  It was an honor and privilege to sponsor -- and speak -- at this great event. They are in year #2, and it's only going to get better.

##The Present

Fast forward to today. This week is one of those weeks that I get to truly love my job and talk to developers all over the country. Syncano will be in Little Rock on Friday for [Little Rock Tech Fest](lrtechfest.com), and in Atlanta on Friday and Saturday for [ConnectJS](connect-js.com).  Both of these events have been around for a while, and we are very excited to be Gold sponsors for both. On Monday and Tuesday of next week, we head to Raleigh for [All Things Open](http://allthingsopen.org/).  ATO has an amazing lineup, and is one event that we just couldn't miss.

##The Future

Next month, we will be headed to Cherry Hill, New Jersey, for [CHE Hacks](https://chehacks.com/), followed by Kansas City for [Midwest.io](http://www.midwest.io/), and then we’ll finally wrap up the year in Toronto for [Full Stack Toronto](http://fsto.co/)!   

###We want to sponsor your events!
If you’re planning on attending any of these, be sure to stop by and say hello -- to me, this is really the best part of my job. I enjoy meeting different people, talking about how they like to code, and learning a little more every time I do. If you have an event you would like Syncano to sponsor in your community, be sure to send me an email as well -- I would love to hear from you!
