summary: "Angular is a web framework for the front-end of your application. Itâ€™s responsible for accepting data from the middleware of your application and vice versa. Angular.js is similar to other templating engines. For those of you coming from Python, Angular is similar to jinja2. For those of you coming from Ruby, this is similar to HAML."
