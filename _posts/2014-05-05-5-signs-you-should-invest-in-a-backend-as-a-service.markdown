When you’re trying to build applications quickly and efficiently, your team needs to focus on things like growth, innovation, and rapid development. Using a Backend as a Service (BaaS) can give your team the flexibility to focus on what's most important and create powerful applications, faster. Here are five signs you would benefit from a BaaS.<!--more-->
<h2><b>You want to innovate—but can’t afford the financial risk</b></h2>
You envision stunning real-time user experiences and your team can create apps that are game-changers for your own company or your clients, but you doubt whether your financial resources can cover the risk of investing in building your own backend. Using a reliable BaaS provider will give you a little more flexibility in your budget, so you can focus on disruptive new ideas and unlock the potential of what you do best. A pay-as-you-go option with variable rates based on usage can also make it easy to keep your spend in line with needs.
<h2><b>You don’t have the bandwidth for scalable servers</b></h2>
With potential surges in usage and the need to be constantly growing, you often worry about whether your bandwidth is enough to handle server workload at scale. A Backend as a Service that offers unlimited scale can handle both surges and growth, so you can worry about the value and utility of your app - not your bandwidth.
<h2><b>Your team needs to focus on the front-end</b></h2>
Some enterprises have the resources to build their own backend if they choose, but you need to squeeze the most out of the staff you have. With strong front-end developers and designers that can impress your clients, users, and investors, consider using a BaaS as a form of strategic outsourcing to better allocate your finances and energy.
<h2><b>You want to focus on more strategic initiatives</b></h2>
Your company has monetary goals to reach, so you need more time to focus on strategy and innovation. Not only does a Backend as a Service free up your time to focus on other tasks; it gives your applications the power and agility to work with different platforms and use multiple libraries as needed. Your next project will need a reliable backend system, and BaaS gives you that along with the flexibility and portability for future adjustments when your strategies change.
<h2><b>Deadlines are tight and you don’t have the time to build your own backend</b></h2>
If you feel backed up against deadlines, you need integrated backend infrastructure and fast deployment. Building your own complex backend with capabilities like real-time synchronization, notifications, access management, and data modeling can put you well behind deadlines and you can’t afford to disappoint a client or investor. A great BaaS provider will be there when you need them to help you reach your goals faster.
