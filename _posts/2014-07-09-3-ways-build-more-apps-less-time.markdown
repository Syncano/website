summary: "'How fast can you build it?' You’ve probably heard this question a thousand times. A few years ago, building apps quickly wasn’t an option. You had to keep multiple moving parts in mind, synchronize your team, and estimate a timeline that extended far into the future. But with today’s technology, you can build more apps in less time, keep your clients happy, and grow your business at the same time – you just need a few good shortcuts. The good news is: we know what they are. Here are three expert tips so you can develop high-quality apps in less time."

“How fast can you build it?” You’ve probably heard this question a thousand times. A few years ago, building apps quickly wasn’t an option. You had to keep multiple moving parts in mind, synchronize your team, and estimate a timeline that extended far into the future. But with today’s technology, you can build more apps in less time, keep your clients happy, and grow your business at the same time - you just need a few good shortcuts. The good news is: we know what they are. Here are three expert tips so you can develop high-quality apps in less time.<!--more-->
<h2><strong>1. Change the way you collaborate</strong></h2>
Cut out downtime during development with productivity tools that allow more employees to work from home and communicate in real-time across different platforms and geographical locations. You’ll finish more apps quickly when your team members can work where and how they want, because it will maximize their individual efficiency and speed up development.
<h2><strong>2. Use Backend as a Service and focus on what you do best</strong></h2>
Utilize third parties whenever possible, and don't recreate technologies that already exist. For example, instead of spending time and resources building a backend, hire a Backend as a Service and save your energy for an incredible front-end and sharp user experience loaded with features. BaaS not only reduces overhead and speeds up your time to market, but it also provides APIs, user management, storage, real-time data synchronization, and more. Plus, it's secure and ready to scale.
<h2><strong>3. Speed up testing with Continuous Integration</strong></h2>
Your development workflow should be as automated as possible so you can focus your time on building a product that provides value to your users. Automated testing and Continuous Integration means you can detect errors immediately - saving precious development time and allowing you to iterate and innovate quickly without breaking your app. We recommend using tools like <a href="http://www.codeship.io">Codeship</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis</a>, and <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> to automate your testing and keep your users (and you!) happy.
