# Syncano is speaking at Music City of Code

Catch Kelly Andrews, our very own Syncano Developer Evangelist, in Nashville Tennessee on Saturday at the Music City of Code. He will be participating in a panel about the Future of Web along with Jonathan Mills and Lee Brandt from PaigeLabs, Eric Potter, and Robert Boedigheimer. Together, they will discuss the potential standardization of web development tools, languages, platforms and libraries, or how the Internet of Things may impact how we develop for the web. 

Donâ€™t miss this conversation if you are attending the Music City of Code on Saturday, August 29th! (and you can always catch some good live music on Sunday).
