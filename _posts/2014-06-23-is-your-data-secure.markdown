When looking at data storage providers, you want speed and scalability to power your applications. You also need security—and not all data security methods are equal. Here are questions you should be asking your data storage provider to gauge the effectiveness and reliability of physical and virtual security for your data.<!--more-->
<h2><b>How is my data encrypted at the facility?</b></h2>
Don’t let a conversation about data encryption end without getting a full picture of the encryption process and access. Does the provider use one or two encryption keys, and who exactly has the keys?

Two-key encryption offers a stronger level of security that may be desirable for your needs.  The facility might require both a password and biometrics, for example. The codes and passwords might change at regular intervals, too. Whether or not you consider your data a target for security breaches, there are benefits to stronger security—you don’t want to deal with the aftermath of a hack, and you can tout your level of encryption to customers.
<h2><b>Is the data encrypted while being transferred?</b></h2>
In addition to encryption while being stored, your data can be encrypted while in transit. Ask storage providers about the security of your data while being transmitted and when accessed from the cloud.
<h2><b>How frequently is my data backed up?</b></h2>
Backing up data more frequently can prevent data loss in the event of a disaster or outage. Creating more backups also means taking up more storage space. Work with your storage provider to create a solution that best suits your needs and budget. Some payment models have steep overage charges for extra data, so be sure to include projections for growing file sizes every time you back up.
<h2><b>Do the facilities have backup power and cooling?</b></h2>
Data storage also needs to provide for the physical safety of your data. Climate monitoring, alarm systems, and geo-redundancy technologies have proliferated in recent years. Ask your storage provider about backup cooling units and power in the event of facility problems, local power outages, and natural disasters. If the facility gets flooded, will your data be transferred to another location?
<h2><b>What quality of failover solutions are provided?</b></h2>
You need your data protected and available as much as possible—protection from natural causes is one thing, but minimizing downtime presents a daily concern. Ask data storage services how quickly your data can be transferred over to a mirror drive and whether the data will be available during downtimes at their facility. Reducing downtime keeps your employees working and your customers using applications without noticing any problems.

Different businesses have different security needs. Make sure you’re getting an appropriate and affordable level of security for your data while keeping in mind the potential risks of compromised or lost data.
