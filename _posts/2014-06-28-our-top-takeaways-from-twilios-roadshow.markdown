<p dir="ltr">This month, we joined <a href="http://roadshow.twilio.com/">Twilio’s “Engineering the Customer Experience” Roadshow</a> - an event designed to help developers and companies engineer great customer experiences in our new software-defined world. With a room full of forward-thinking engineers and decision-makers, John Rymer, VP and Principal Analyst at Forrester, imparted these need-to-know tips to New York City's tech leaders.<!--more--></p>

<h2 dir="ltr">1. Everyone in the company must embrace change.</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Prototype, build, deploy, and change. This “Minimum Viable Product” method of building businesses is the new norm, and it requires a team in which every individual member embraces change. Companies must develop and deploy at web speed with a strong culture of communication and innovation.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">2. The customer has all the power.</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We’ve entered what Rymer calls “The Age of the Customer.” Customers are driven by technology and empowered by mobile web and social media. Through access to unlimited information at any given time, they can make qualified decisions on which products or services they will use. Their expectations for companies have also evolved, demanding that companies:</p>

<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">treat them as individuals.</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">make purchasing fun.</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">make it easy to do what they need to do.</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">give them more information and help.</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">be consistent across channels.</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">let them help themselves (get out of their way).</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">be open 24/7.</p>
</li>
</ol>
These expectations have changed the way customers interact with and purchase products - ultimately altering the way we develop them.
<h2>3. Modern apps are built on top of existing services.</h2>
The separation between IT and business is gone. These two departments must constantly work together to make sure they quickly deliver what the customer wants and needs.
<p dir="ltr">Because application development is so complicated, it’s almost impossible for companies to build applications entirely on their own with normal constraints on time and cost. “Modern apps” use APIs or third party services to remove this burden and focus on the customer-facing, sales-generating parts of their product. These apps are more complex, personalized, elastic enough for sudden bursts in usage, and flexible enough to accommodate changes in customer demands and new technology.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">4. Everything will depend on the cloud.</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The web era was composed of a 3 tier architecture. But in the age of the customer, apps require a 4 tier, dynamic architecture that’s hugely dependent on the cloud, 3rd party APIs, multiple devices, and large amounts of data.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We use the cloud because it’s quick and easy. It gives us speedy delivery and the ability to make fast changes at mass scale - two crucial benefits for an app that wants to succeed in the Age of the Customer. According to Rymer, application architectures must maximize use of the cloud in order to also:</p>

<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">support all devices</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">offer multiple services to cater to every customer’s needs</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">scale elastically</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">adopt an agile methodology that always begins with a minimum viable product</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">be closely tied to the business and sales teams to allow for rapid iteration</p>
</li>
</ul>
All of these things are going to be crucial in creating the apps of today and of the future, and we’re excited to be a part of the network of APIs that’s going to power them!
