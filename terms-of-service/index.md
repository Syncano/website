<b>3.1</b> In addition to our rights to terminate or suspend Services to You as described in Section 2 above, You acknowledge that: (i) Your access to and use of the Services may be suspended for the duration of any unanticipated or unscheduled downtime or unavailability of any portion or all of the Services for any reason, including as a result of power outages, system failures or other interruptions; and (ii) we shall also be entitled, without any liability to You, to suspend access to any portion or all of the Services at any time, on a Service-wide basis: (a) for scheduled downtime to permit us to conduct maintenance or make modifications to any Service; (b) in the event of a denial of service attack or other attack on the Service or other event that we determine, in our sole discretion, may create a risk to the applicable Service, to You or to any of our other customers if the Service were not suspended; or (c) in the event that we determine that any Service is prohibited by applicable law or we otherwise determine that it is necessary or prudent to do so for legal or regulatory reasons (collectively, "Service Suspensions"). Without limitation to Section 7, we shall have no liability whatsoever for any damage, liabilities, losses (including any loss of data or profits) or any other consequences that You may incur as a result of any Service Suspension. To the extent we are able, we will endeavor to provide You notice of any Service Suspension in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in Section 10 below and to post updates regarding resumption of Services following any such suspension, but shall have no liability for the manner in which we may do so or if we fail to do so.

We will have no liability to You for any unauthorized access or use, corruption, deletion, destruction or loss of any of Your content.

<b>4. Promotional Credits</b>

<b>4.1</b> We may award bonus codes, credits, points or any of our other virtual currencies (each individually or collectively referred to as “Promotional Credits”) in connection with promotions or other giveaways. Acquisition of Promotional Credits provides only a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use such Promotional Credits to access Services that we expressly make available for use with the Promotional Credits. Promotional Credits have no monetary value and do not constitute currency or property of any type. Promotional Credits may not be sold or transferred, and cannot be exchanged for cash or for any other goods or services, except for Services. We may cancel any Promotional Credits transferred, assigned or sold in violation of this Agreement.

<b>4.2</b> Promotional Credits are limited to the user account it has been registered to and one user account can only have Promotional Credit code registered, and the one with the highest amount will be effective while any other registered Promotional Credits will be void. For the avoidance of doubt, even if there each user account can have more than one instance, any Promotional Credits granted by Syncano is limited to the user account and not per instance.

<b>4.3</b> The term of Your Promotional Credits license starts when You acquire such Promotional Credits and, subject to this Agreement, expires upon the earlier of (a) twelve months from the date of award (as the context requires and applicable to each individual award); or (b) the date set when the Promotional Credits were acquired. If You do not use Your account for six months, or if You delete Your account, any remaining Promotional Credits may be redeemed, cancelled or expired by us. Once Promotional Credits are redeemed for Services, such Services are not returnable, exchangeable or refundable for Promotional Credits or any other virtual currency, or for cash or goods or services.

<b>4.4</b> Promotional Credits may only be held by legal residents of countries where access to and use of the Services and Promotional Credits are permitted. Promotional Credits may only be awarded by us or through means we provide on the Website or otherwise expressly authorize. We can cancel or suspend Your access to Promotional Credits in our sole discretion and without prior notice, if (a) You fail to comply with this Agreement; or (b) if we otherwise suspect fraud or misuse of Promotional Credits. We have no obligation or responsibility to, and will not reimburse You for, any Promotional Credits lost due to such cancellation or suspension.

<b>4.5</b> We have the absolute right to offer, manage, regulate, modify and/or eliminate Promotional Credits or any portion thereof, at any time, without any liability to You.

Additionally, You shall provide us with documentation that the withholding and deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.

<b>5.4</b> Should You have any claim and/or disputes as to fees associated with Your account, please contact us at hello@syncano.com within 90 days of the date of the activity that generated such dispute, and we will attempt to resolve the matter.

<b>8.2</b> We agree to promptly notify You of any claim subject to indemnification; provided that our failure to promptly notify You shall not affect Your obligations hereunder except to the extent that our failure to promptly notify You delays or prejudices Your ability to defend the claim. At our option, You will have the right to defend against any such claim with counsel of Your own choosing (subject to our written consent) and to settle such claim as You deem appropriate, provided that You shall not enter into any settlement without our prior written consent and provided that we may, at any time, elect to take over control of the defense and settlement of the claim.

<b>9. Disputes</b>

<b> </b>

<b>9.1</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may seek injunctive or other relief in any state, federal, or national court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or alleged infringement of Syncano’s or any third party's intellectual property rights and/or proprietary rights. You further acknowledge that our rights in the Syncano Services, Syncano Properties and the Syncano Marks are of a special, unique, extraordinary character, giving them peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be readily estimated and may not be adequately compensated for in monetary damages.

<b>9.2</b> By using the Services, You agree that the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws, will govern this Agreement and any dispute of any sort that might arise between You and us.

<b>9.3</b> Arbitration. YOU AND Syncano BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ONLY BY ARBITRATION. THERE'S NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND THE PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD. IF THE LAW ALLOWS FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM TOO. YOU AND Syncano ALSO BOTH AGREE THAT:

<b>9.3.1</b> THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT. ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM ANY SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US WILL BE RESOLVED BY ONE OR MORE NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA"). YOU CAN ALSO BRING ANY ISSUES YOU MAY HAVE TO THE ATTENTION OF FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND IF THE LAW ALLOWS, THEY CAN SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US FOR YOU.

<b>9.3.2</b> UNLESS YOU AND Syncano AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK.

<b>9.3.3</b> THIS AGREEMENT DOESN'T ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

<b>9.3.4</b> IF EITHER YOU OR Syncano INTENDS TO SEEK ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTY SEEKING ARBITRATION MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE OTHER PARTY OF THE DISPUTE IN WRITING AT LEAST 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF INITIATING THE ARBITRATION. NOTICE TO Syncano SHOULD BE SENT AS REQUIRED BY THIS AGREEMENT. THE NOTICE MUST DESCRIBE THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM AND THE RELIEF BEING SOUGHT. IF YOU AND Syncano ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE OUR DISPUTE WITHIN 30 DAYS, EITHER PARTY MAY THEN PROCEED TO FILE A CLAIM FOR ARBITRATION.

<b>9.3.5</b> AN ARBITRATION AWARD AND ANY JUDGMENT CONFIRMING IT APPLY ONLY TO THAT SPECIFIC CASE; IT CAN'T BE USED IN ANY OTHER CASE EXCEPT TO ENFORCE THE AWARD ITSELF.

<b>9.3.6</b> IF FOR SOME REASON THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATIONS SET FORTH IN SUBSECTION (3) CANNOT BE ENFORCED, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY.

<b>9.3.7</b> IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND Syncano AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND Syncano UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT. YOU AND Syncano ALSO AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER SHALL BE ADJUDICATED IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK, AND YOU CONSENT TO EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN SUCH COURTS.
