            <p>Syncano is committed to ensuring the privacy of your information. We have created this Privacy Policy to help explain about how we handle Information (collectively “Information”) that we receive from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) in connection with our product, Performance Insight.</p>
            <p>Syncano complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. Syncano has certified that it adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <a href='https://www.privacyshield.gov/'>privacyshield.gov</a></p>
            <p>This policy applies to all personal information received by Syncano whether in electronic, paper, or verbal format.</p>

            <h3>Definitions</h3>
            <p>“Personal Information” means information that is (1) transferred from the EEA to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.</p>
            <p>“Sensitive Personal Information” means information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual’s health.</p>

            <h3>What kind of Personal Information do Syncano collect?</h3>
            <p>Syncano may collect information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work or at home.</p>

            <h3>Why does Syncano collect your personal information?</h3>
            <p>If You provide personally identifiable information for a certain reason, we may use the personally identifiable information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if You contact us by e-mail, we will use the personally identifiable information you provide to answer Your question or resolve Your problem. Also, if You provide personally identifiable information in order to obtain access to the Syncano Website or Services, we will use such information to provide You with access to such services and to monitor Your use of such services. Further, your personally identifiable information may be used to provide You with new product information and support services offered on the Syncano Website, to notify you of technical updates or changes in policy, to improve the content and functionality of the Syncano Website and Services, to help us better understand our users, or to deliver other services.</p>

            <h3>Notice</h3>
            <p>Syncano is a platform for app developers. You can create an app on the Service, and then all personal data will get stored on Syncano’s servers. Therefor Syncano does not collect Information from individuals directly. However, Information is received from affiliates or third-parties in the EEA for the purpose of providing technical support and maintenance. Syncano will use and disclose such information only in accordance with the notices provided by such entities. Types of data may include e.g., name, mailing or email address, biometric data etc.</p>

            <h3>Choice</h3>
            <p>Syncano is a data processor who cannot extend choice, therefore individuals will be referred to the entity with which they placed their original information. If an individual opts-out when the data is collected by the affiliate or third-party in the EEA, Syncano has no means of receiving that individual’s Information.</p>

            <h3>Onward Transfer</h3>
            <p>Syncano is not in the business of selling your information. We consider your personal information to be a vital part of our relationship with You. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your personally identifiable information with certain third parties without further notice to You, as set forth below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Third Party Applications and Services: If You elect to use one or more third party applications that interoperate with the Service, those applications may upon Your election be given access to data (which may include personally identifiable information) on Syncano's systems generated in connection with Your use of the Service. Please remember that Syncano is not responsible for the policies and practices of third party application providers, and Syncano shall have no liability arising from any action of any such provider as it concerns Your data or information or otherwise. In connection with your use of any such third party applications, please review carefully the applicable privacy policies each such third party application provider to become familiar with their policies and practices as it concerns your data and information.</li>
              <li>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personally identifiable information may be part of the transferred assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer or successor of Syncano may continue to use Your information as set forth in this policy.</li>
              <li>Related Companies: We may also share your personally identifiable information with any entity that is affiliated with us for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Syncano requires that the related companies either certify with the Privacy Shield agreement or enter into a written agreement with us that requires them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Privacy Shield Principles.</li>
              <li>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Syncano, like many businesses, sometimes uses other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. Syncano requires that its agents and service providers either certify with the Privacy Shield agreement or enter into a written agreement with us that requires them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Privacy Shield Principles.</li>
              <li>Legal Requirements and Other Circumstances: Syncano may disclose Your personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Syncano, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Syncano Website or Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Syncano is therefore potentially liable.</p>

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>Syncano takes commercially reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Syncano has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure the Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, Syncano cannot guarantee the security of Information on or transmitted via the Internet.</p>
            <p>We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

            <h3>Data Integrity</h3>
            <p>Syncano’s access to Information is limited due to the relationship between Syncano and its affiliates and third-parties. As such, Syncano does not have a direct impact on the integrity of the data it stores and cannot make any representations as to data integrity.</p>
            <p>However, Syncano may not process personal information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.</p>

            <h3>Access and Correction</h3>
            <p>Due to the relationship between Syncano and its affiliates and third-parties, Syncano has only limited access to an individual’s data. However, individuals will have the right to access personal data concerning themselves if they were to require it. Furthermore, individuals have the opportunity to correct, modify or delete personal information about them if such information has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield principles.</p>
            <p>As such, Syncano will forward any requests to access and correct an individual’s information to the appropriate affiliate or third-party. To notify us of a change in your details, please contact the Privacy Officer. A formal request from an individual for information that we hold about them must be made in writing.</p>

            <h3>Enforcement and Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>Syncano will periodically verify that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible and in conformity with the Principles.</p>
