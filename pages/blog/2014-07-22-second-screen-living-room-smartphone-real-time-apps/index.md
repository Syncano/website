summary: "The TV was probably your first screen. Maybe you huddled around the screen with your family to watch a sporting event or you and your friends went to the movie theater to see the latest hit. TV was a way to be entertained, to engage with others, and to learn about the world around us. But the introduction of smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers caused a conundrum to TV broadcasters and advertisers alike. Our attention is no longer focused on our 'first' screens (or even the companions we watched it with). Instead, our smartphones, computers, and tablets have begun to distract us with social media and the joy of on-demand content. TV isn’t engaging enough now to hold our attention through revenue generating advertisements — or is it?"

The TV was probably your first screen. Maybe you huddled around the screen with your family to watch a sporting event or you and your friends went to the movie theater to see the latest hit. TV was a way to be entertained, to engage with others, and to learn about the world around us. But the introduction of smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers caused a conundrum to TV broadcasters and advertisers alike. Our attention is no longer focused on our “first” screens (or even the companions we watched it with). Instead, our smartphones, computers, and tablets have begun to distract us with social media and the joy of on-demand content. TV isn’t engaging enough now to hold our attention through revenue generating advertisements — or is it?

The high level of engagement on other devices and “second” screens means that viewers are more likely to watch advertisements online. As an added benefit, they can click and engage with the advertisements themselves and make a purchase – all during a commercial break. During this year’s Oscars, women who used twitter throughout the show watched the program <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/-1885731.htm">39% longer</a> than women who didn’t tweet. The answer for broadcasters, then, is the creation of real-time “second screen” applications – experiences that compliment the on-air broadcast of shows, increase audience engagement, and generate the added benefit of social media buzz.

This solution has seemed to work. For avid sports fans in particular, the tablet is now becoming increasingly important during TV sport events. <a href="http://www.stats.com/pdfs/secondscreen.pdf">Sports fans</a> are 52% more likely to own a tablet than non-avid sports fans, and – because of new real-time sync technology – almost a third of tablet users ages 25-64 check sport scores on their computers while watching TV. More and more, people are using apps on second screens to interact with television programs in real-time.

Beyond sporting events, networks like the CW and HBO provide features like video previews and social sharing to keep users engaged with content. AMC’s <a href="http://www.amctv.com/shows/the-walking-dead/story-sync">The Walking Dead Story Sync</a> lets fans engage in snap polls, trivia, quotes, still photos, and flashbacks while watching the latest episodes on air. Conan O’Brian lets fans go behind the scenes with the <a href="http://teamcoco.com/togo">Team Coco app</a>. By tapping ‘Sync” on the app while watching an episode of the show, viewers can access extra content on their mobile devices.<strong> </strong>

With the invention of streaming devices, our second screens have shifted from complementing live programming to powering programming itself. Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/devices/chromecast/">Chromecast</a> and the <a href="https://www.roku.com">Roku Streaming Stick</a> lets users stream content from any device to their TV. Other devices like <a href="https://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a> let you completely mirror your second screen, stream music, photo slideshows, and more. The release of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-streaming-media-player/dp/B00CX5P8FC">Amazon Fire TV</a> takes the second screen even further – allowing existing Amazon users to enjoy Netflix, low-cost music rentals, and much more on their TVs via voice command. These hardwares are changing the function of TV screens and turning them into complements for the online experience rather than the other way around.

So is the "second" screen in your living room your smartphone, or is it the TV? With an increasing number of households using TVs to broadcast content only when a tablet, phone, or laptop is available to power them, we'd like to think it's the latter. People prefer the ability to stream on-demand content, interact on social media, and access the internet simultaneously. TVs will soon incorporate features like auto-support for streaming and virtual remote control. Internet-connected devices are changing the way we use TVs, and the handheld devices once called "second screens" will soon become the most important items in the living room.
