Patience is indeed a virtue, but when it comes to using apps and technology, patience is quickly becoming a thing of the past. We live in the “I want it now” era where people are increasingly demanding access to the things they want in seconds. And, as the “Internet of things” begins to become a reality, people simply expect their information to be immediately and securely available on any and all of their devices at any time, without waiting. For app developers this means putting the highest priority on real-time sync and other innovations that enable information to be instantly shared safely across all devices.

To stay relevant in the “I want it now” era, there are three things every backend developer should be focusing on to stay ahead.
<h2><b>1. Real-time sync: Data in an instant.</b></h2>
As a developer, you experience the promise of technology day in and day out. You are already aware of the promise real-time sync offers for the app industry. But as you may have experienced already, creating applications that can seamlessly sync a users’ information across any device or platform isn’t always the easiest thing to accomplish. Many backend services don't think beyond the traditional smartphone and tablet. In the age of the Internet of Things, highly complex data will need be synced and shared across so many other devices—including cars, homes, watches, glasses, shopping carts, medical devices and much more.

Apps of the future will need to real-time sync with so many things, while maintaining advanced scalability and the security that users have come to expect.

Which leads us to…
<h2><b>2. Scalability: Offering unlimited capacity for growth. </b></h2>
Scalability has more traditionally been the focus of front end developers, as creating scalable solutions tend to be easier using front-end databases. However, today backend developers need to really make scalability a major focus to create the kind of innovations that will matter most. Companies who depend on backend solutions need to have their storage grow as their size grows. Thankfully, there are already solutions in place that can give backend developers the kind of unlimited capacity they need to create leading-edge scalable apps that can handle a data surge of any size.
<h2><b>3. Security: Keeping data safe is more important than ever. </b></h2>
Security has always been one of the most important things for developers to focus on. Without users feeling confident about the apps you build, the apps simply won’t be successful. Data protection matters even more today, as there many more threats to technology—from human threats to blackouts and natural disasters. As a backend developer, protecting your data with two-key encryption is a smart way to go. Requiring two separate keys for any one piece of data helps ensure that it stays safe at all times, even during real-time sync with other devices and platforms.
<h2><b>Three areas of focus—and one bright future</b></h2>
The future for technology (and for the developers who are ushering this future in) is brighter and more exciting than ever. In short, meeting people’s demand for instant gratification while focusing on the things that will matter most in the coming Internet of Things (like scalability and security) will help you stay on top of the game—and get to the next app innovation faster than ever.

If you don't have the tools need to offer what users are demanding, it's worth looking into the solutions that are available today to help backend developers thrive.
