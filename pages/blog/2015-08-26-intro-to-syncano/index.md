## Introducing Syncano

App development is hard. Some aspects tend to be harder to get right than others. As developers, we enjoy unknown challenges, but there are times when we just need to get our product on the shelf - and the faster the better. Time to production is getting smaller but requirements remain the same - so we end up taking shortcuts that can cause problems down the road. 

Different products exist to help, but tying all of these microservices together can be an additional challenge with additional workarounds and maintenance headaches - taking away from the real task of solving the actual problem the app is intended to solve. There needs to be a better way. 

## Enter Syncano
Syncano gets it - and it’s the very reason we exist. Setting up a server, databases, user authentication and permissions, API routes, other microservice integrations - they are all parts of your application that have to be built somehow, and end up taking the bulk of the time. Isn’t solving the problem supposed to be the focus? 

Of course it is - and all of the pieces work towards the ultimate solution. That’s why Syncano exists. We want to see your application solve real problems to get to a solution as fast as possible, and helping solve the backend challenges is the least we could do.

## How Can We Help?
Over the upcoming weeks, we will take a deeper dive into Syncano and how it can help your app development process. First, I want to highlight a few items for you to start investigating yourself.
 
### *First Things First*
Every good backend will have a storage solution - PostgreSQL and MongoDB are just two of the favorites lately. Syncano takes care of that for you with classes and data objects. Classes allow you to create a relation schema to represent your data requirements, and the data objects are your records. Couple that with class and object level permissions, and your application will be serving data to its users in no time.

### *What’s an App Without Users?*
As long as we are already on the concept of permissions, every app instance automatically gives you a user_profile class to create and authenticate users. Login functionality for username and passwords, as well as social channels, is built in - giving you one less thing to worry about.

### *Run Your Own Code*
Syncano comes equipped with CodeBox - built using Docker containers - allowing you additional create functionality using Python, NodeJS, Ruby or Golang. With CodeBox, you can aggregate data on a schedule, trigger services with events, create webhooks for tighter integrations, or run them on an ad-hoc basis. You can even code and test them right from your own dashboard. 

### *Keeping it Real (time)*
Data has to stay up-to-date. That’s why Syncano offers Channels so your apps are always in sync across multiple platforms. Simply subscribe to a Channel and update your apps frontend to reflect the changes. It’s that easy.

## Just Getting Started
This is just the first post of many to come. We will go deeper into the entire platform in the next post to get you familiar with all that Syncano can do for you.

There are so many opportunities for apps and I want to be a part of helping you make that a reality. I’m also excited to interact with each of you on your journey. Be sure to follow [@syncano](https://twitter.com/syncano) on twitter, and you can say hi to me [@kellyjandrews](https://twitter.com/kellyjandrews). I can’t wait to hear what problems you are solving and how we can help.
