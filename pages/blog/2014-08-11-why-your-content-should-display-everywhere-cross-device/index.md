summary: "The release of the smartphone revolutionized the way humans interacted with each other, but this was just the beginning of a major worldwide technological shift. With the introduction of tablets, smartwatches, smart TVs, and other non-mobile technology, people are connecting to the internet through multiple screens, and cross-device interactions are on the rise. A recent Google study projected 84% of consumers would start shopping on one device and finish a purchase on another. And when it comes to television, a whopping 84% of smartphone and tablet owners use their devices as second screens while watching TV programming. The addition of multiple screens is an opportunity for brands to reach consumers in new ways. But how do brands ensure their messages reach consumers, no matter what platform they’re on?

The addition of multiple screens is an opportunity for brands to reach consumers in new ways. But how do brands ensure their messages reach consumers, no matter what platform they’re on? Here are some best practices to ensure your company’s content can reach its cross-device consumers.<!--more-->
<h2>Simplify your user experience.</h2>
Mobile web users spend 86% of their time on applications, and only 14% of their time on mobile web browsers. Yet 55% of these users are still shopping on mobile browsers. So if users overall are spending most of their time on mobile applications, why aren’t they shopping on them?

According to a study by Business Insider Intelligence, mobile shoppers don’t use applications because they’re less time efficient, contain a lack of discounts, and “are too complicated to bother with.” But getting users to use cross-device applications to shop have clear benefits including data retention to create personalized experiences for specific shoppers.

The solution: simplify your applications to make them quicker, faster, and easier to use. Create device-only promotions to incentivize users to purchase products they’re browsing and synchronize experiences by using data analysis to show users only the information they are interested in seeing.
<h2>Make it easier to switch between different channels.</h2>
Deb Shops, an online teenage clothing store, used technology and analytics to personalize a consumer’s experience across devices without requiring a login and tripled their consumers’ average time spent on their site, pages views, and conversion rates.

By making it easier for consumers to switch between devices without having to re-enter their data, their search terms and even their browser history, your company can reap great rewards. Shop Direct’s head of user experience Sam Burton said this is the “golden bullet” for brands, as customers who shop across devices are 15 times more valuable than those who shop on just one.
<h2>Select the right real-time software to power apps</h2>
With consumers expecting multiple screens to complete one single, fluid user experience, your content will be expected to be ever-constant across devices, and it will be important for you to invest in a strong backend with the ability to synchronize data across devices without a lag time. While creating applications that can accomplish this task is difficult, companies like Syncano have spent years developing backends that instantly sync your data across devices in real time without any lag time or extra legwork – a great resource for multi-screen functionality.
