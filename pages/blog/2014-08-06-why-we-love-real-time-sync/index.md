Syncing data across devices and servers in real-time not only makes it easier for you to bridge, build, scale and manage your apps effectively; it makes virtual engagements feel more real. Whether you are developing cool apps solely for the enjoyment of your fellow man or are creating experiences that you, too, want to embrace, here’s some reasons we know you’ll love real-time sync:<!--more-->
<h2>It empowers the voice of the consumer</h2>
Developers using real-time sync to create apps enable the audience's voices to be heard. With second screen apps like <a href="http://www.syncano.com/second-screen/">Havoc 247</a>, anyone in the audience can vote to make decisions about programming. You can also let everyone know – in real-time – what you think about the show and have conversations even when you're watching TV alone.
<h2>It gives fans up-to-the-millisecond updates</h2>
Real-time synced sports apps not only allow you to check stats and current scores of your favorite teams; they also let you enjoy live action by watching games through video feeds or listening via streamlining radio. Syncano powers a European app (in development) that also enables live betting from your phone or tablet within seconds.
<h2>It makes games more fun with more players</h2>
Multiplayer game development requires quite a bit of work on the backend because any delay between players can disrupt the entire game. But multiplayer games are just that fun, and <a href="http://www.syncano.com/gaming/">adding multiplayer functionality</a> to your game could be the one thing that gives it the oomph it needs to go viral. Flappy Bird multiplayer? Whoa - we don't even think the public can handle that yet.
<h2>It makes the world a little smaller</h2>
Real-time sync is what powers fast sharing of your photos and files on your phone or mobile device as well as the notifications you receive for every new email. It enables friends from around the world to stay in contact no matter the distance, and coworkers in a distributed office to stay in touch no matter the hour. It's a small world, after all.
