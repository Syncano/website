How do great developers get to be that way? It’s not just because they have a knack for solving thorny programming problems. It’s not because they write bug-free code—no one does. It’s because they understand the big picture: how both the business and development cycle work, and what the best practices to support them. Here are five big-picture mistakes that the great developers never make:
<h2>Forgetting to plan ahead</h2>
Coders love to do what? Code! The trouble is, some developers love to code so much that they skip the planning step and end up rewriting code over and over again. Planning is important because it requires you to understand the context of the code you are writing—how does it relate to the pieces that other coders are working on? What enhancements will be needed two or three versions down the road, and how can you code to anticipate those future needs?
<h2>Not understanding the requirements – or the end users</h2>
This one is closely related to planning. Without understanding the system and functional requirements, the business rules and processes, or the end users and their problems, you may write code that brilliantly solves the wrong problem.
<h2>Using borrowed code without understanding it</h2>
No matter what the programming problem is, looking for a solution someone else has already created and tweaking it a bit will probably cause more of a headache than actually solving it yourself – especially if you don’t really understand what the borrowed code does. You might end up spending more time on it than if you had started from scratch or even cause other unforeseen issues.
<h2>Under-documenting (or not documenting) code</h2>
Did you ever write a piece of code that was so simple and elegant it needed no explanation – only to spend a ton of time a year or two later re-figuring it out? Great developers go through a lot of trouble to document their code, so other developers can edit it with ease. It can take a lot of time up front, but it will save someone, possibly yourself, a lot of time later on.
<h2>Expanding the scope of the project</h2>
You’ve been asked to update a piece of code, and you realize it would be better/faster/more efficient/prettier if you could just spend a few days redesigning it from the ground up. But doing that will likely cause project delays – or at worst, bring the whole system to a screeching halt. Great developers keep the scope limited to the task at hand. When there is a compelling need to refactor code, that will become a project of its own.
