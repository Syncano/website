If you’re a developer or entrepreneur that has relied on Parse, it’s only natural to be saddened and confused by the news of Facebook shutting down its services in a year. At Syncano, we empathize with those that have to consider the future of their applications and the choices that must be made -- most importantly, whom to trust.

We want to make this transition as smooth as possible and give you the tools to determine whether Syncano is right for you. Within the next week, we will walk you through a comparison of Parse and Syncano to help you make that decision. Furthermore, we want to address that Syncano is an independent startup. While we don’t have the budget of a billion dollar company, we do have the freedom to be agile and build based on our developers’ evolving needs -- bottom line, we’re your #1 fan and we want to prove that we care about you!

If you’re interested in giving Syncano a test drive, we’re here to help you in any way to make this hurdle not as painful. All of Syncano’s features are free to use for 6 months. We have a dedicated support team that can guide you through the migration. 

If you want to learn more, check out our docs and please send any requests for help our way at support@syncano.io -- or talk directly with our developers on Gitter!

The future is bright and we’re excited to see what you can build!

The Syncano Team
