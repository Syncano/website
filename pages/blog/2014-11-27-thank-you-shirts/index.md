summary: "We just wanted to take a moment to thank all of our beta users for being incredibly awesome. So we’re giving away free Syncano t-shirts to the first 25 of you that send an email to hello[at]syncano[dot]com with the Subject line “Thoughts for Shirts” and tell us why you use (or don’t use) Syncano, what you love about the platform, and what you wish would be improved before our 2015 launch.
Happy Thanksgiving, Syncano-ers!"
