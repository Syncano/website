We are excited to share Syncano has been selected among 150 of the “most promising” startups in the world - from a pool of thousands of applicants!

<!--more-->Back in February, we applied to be part of the Collision Conference, the first annual US-based conference by <a href="http://www.thesummit.co/">The Summit</a> that brings some of the world’s most promising startups, investors and entrepreneurs together in an effort to shape the future of technology.

For the last three years, The Summit held their <a href="F.ounders">annual conference</a> in Dublin – a tech event considered to be one of the most prestigious in the world. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/haydnshaughnessy/2011/10/28/reed-hastings-on-his-vision-for-netflix/">Forbes</a> described it as the “new hot ticket on the tech conference scene,” while <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/now/2012-06-25/the-davos-for-tech-geeks/">Bloomberg</a> said it was “Davos for geeks” and the “‘Rolls Royce’ of tech events.” Last year’s event generated 10,242 attendees from 98 countries around the world, and this year they are expecting 20,000 attendees. Previously selected startup exhibitors include Uber, Stripe, Nest, Vine, Dropbox, and other now Fortune 500 companies.

Our team is so thrilled to “collide” with an amazing group of startups from around the world at Collision and walk in the shoes of the very successful startups that took this step before us. We can’t wait to learn from like-minded developers, investors, startups, and entrepreneurs and ultimately push the boundaries of what we can accomplish through our real-time sync platform.

As part of our acceptance into the conference, Collision provided us with a complimentary exhibition stand. If you’re in Las Vegas May 13 &amp; 14, come stop by our booth and say hello or <a href="twitter.com:syncano">tweet at us</a> to schedule some time to meet!
