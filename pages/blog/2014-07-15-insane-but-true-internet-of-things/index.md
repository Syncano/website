The "Internet of Things"—it’s a term that gets tossed around a lot. With more and more “things” being connected everyday, the relevancy of the IoT is increasing in our businesses and day-to day-lives. From smart refrigerators to wireless heart monitors, there is no limit to the way things are being connected. Here are four insane “things” you should know about the rapidly advancing Internet of Things.
<h2>1. Your refrigerator is going to outsmart you.</h2>
The days of spoiled milk are gone. This <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/refrigerators/lg-LFX31995ST-french-3-door-refrigerator">smart refrigerator</a> can read radio frequency identification tags on food items as they’re placed into the refrigerator. It looks up those tags on the Internet to identify the food you’ve just bought and notifies you when the food is about to expire. With a quick check of the LCD screen, you can even learn what additional ingredients you need to buy to make a fantastic meal.
<h2>2. You will have more Internet-connected devices than friends.</h2>
Right now, there are twice as many Internet-connected devices as people in the world. But that’s not even close to the number of connected devices we’ll have once the Internet of Things takes hold. According to <a href="http://teqy.co/facts-internet-things-infographic-exigent/">Cisco</a>, in only 6 years we’ll have between 6 and 7 internet-connected devices per person – that’s over 50 billion devices! Cisco estimates the number of “things” that will connect to the internet will ultimately reach a whopping 1.5 trillion.
<h2>3. Even our livestock will be tech-savvy.</h2>
Dutch startup Sparked is planting internet-connected, wireless sensors on the ears of <a href="http://www.symplio.com/2011/09/4-infographics-about-internet-of-things/">cattle</a>. These sensors track the cattle’s vitals and automatically send messages to farmers when a cow is sick or pregnant, helping the farmers prevent disease and monitor the health of their livestock. Each cow transmits 200mb of data annually.
<h2>4. It could save our lives.</h2>
We can monitor ourselves in a similar way. <a href="http://www.corventis.com/">Corventis</a> makes a wireless cardiac monitor that can alert physicians if a patient has a cardiac episode. Using the NUVANT Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (MCT) System, physicians can better diagnose and treat cardiac arrhythmias, like atrial fibrillation. The heart monitor, which can be applied to the chest like a Band-Aid, has been approved by both the FDA and the centers for Medicaid and Medicare.
