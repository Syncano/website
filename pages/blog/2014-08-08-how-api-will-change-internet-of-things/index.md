The dawn of the Application Programming Interface (API) has been an exciting time for developers who are passionate about the coming world of connectivity. There are currently over 11,000 APIs listed on [programmableweb.com](http://programmableweb.com). With an increase in demand and requirements for Internet of Things apps, more and more APIs will emerge to support fast growth in three major ways:

## 1\. Merging front-end and backend development

APIs will allow front-end developers to build production-ready apps without any knowledge of backend code. If you are well-versed in JavaScript but are unsure of how to create things like subscription notifications, an [API client library](http://docs.syncano.io) will bridge the gap and enable you to develop apps single handedly without a backend expert. APIs essentially empower developers to take action and build apps whenever they fancy.

## 2\. Faster development times

For the Internet of Things to thrive, apps will need to perform well across platforms. Software, screens, and platforms will need to be more seamlessly integrated than ever before, and development time will need to be minimized. APIs provide syntax for every programming language, allowing you to create [cross-platform experiences](http://www.syncano.io/second-screen/) with minimal effort. Functionalities like real-time sync that would normally take years to perfect are available at your fingertips, meaning you can easily incorporate agile and lean development processes and iterate more quickly.

## 3\. More complex user experiences

According to [Forrester Research](http://www.forrester.com/Developing+Modern+Applications+With+Agile+Outsourcing+Part+One/fulltext/-/E-RES113281), “Modern apps” use APIs or third party services to remove hurdles and focus on the customer-facing, sales-generating parts of their product. These apps are more complex, personalized, elastic enough for sudden bursts in usage, and flexible enough to accommodate changes in customer demands and new technology. By using multiple APIs in unison, you'll be able to create applications that mix and match a variety of functions to create “modern” user experiences that synchronize every aspect of someone's life. How else would your thermostat talk to your windows, and your windows to your light bulbs? Conjoined APIs that deliver these fully integrated experiences will be the nucleus of the Internet of Things.
