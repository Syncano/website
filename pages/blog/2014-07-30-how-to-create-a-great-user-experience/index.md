By implementing the essential elements of a great user experience, your app will have higher adoption, better conversion and retention rates, an increase in customer satisfaction, and invaluable word-of-mouth referrals. Here are six actions you can take to create the best experience for your users.

## Know your target user.

Instead of trying to create a good user experience for everyone, design a great user experience for a niche group of users—those who are most likely going to use your product or services.

## Simplify the experience.

You have one chance to make a great first impression when a person visits your website or uses your app. Make it simple for users to find what they seek by:

*   Making the path from Point A to Point B efficient and obvious.
*   Making sure the copy is error-free and simple to understand.
*   Ensuring the elements of the app work properly.
*   Preventing encounters with error messages.
*   Making sure the form of an object does not conflict with its perceived meaning. For example, do not underline words that aren’t hyperlinks and avoid including elements that look like buttons if they are not clickable.

## Be relevant and useful.

Everything on a website or app should meet the expectations of your users. Use words and images that add significance to the user experience or do not use them at all. Incorporating anything that is not relevant could hurt your credibility and your position as a thought leader or innovator.

## Add value and take the focus off your company.

Users care about finding a solution to a problem, fulfilling a need and knowing how a product or service will benefit them. Inform and empower your users by offering quality takeaways or something of perceived value.

## Make a personal impact.

Users are people before they are leads, converts or customers. Use the aesthetics and messages on your site to set the tone, guide your users, tap into their emotions and influence their perceptions. Use relevant visual strategies and interactive elements to create a mood and make your users feel valued and fulfilled. Just make sure these elements add to the experience instead of distract from it.

## Be flexible.

The user experience is not static. Needs and perceptions change. Use positive and negative feedback constructively to improve the user experience while maintaining consistency. _Photo Credit: Serj Kij via [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zergev/)_
