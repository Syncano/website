<h1>Syncano Performance Insight Safe Harbor Privacy Policy</h1>
Syncano Inc. (“Syncano”) is committed to ensuring the privacy of your information. We have created this Privacy Policy to help explain about how we handle Information (collectively “Information”) that we receive from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) in connection with our product, Performance Insight.

Syncano has certified that it will adhere to the Privacy Principles of the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor program. More information about the Safe Harbor program and the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018475.asp">here</a>. This policy outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Principles, including the types of information we gather, how we use it, and notice and choice affected individuals have regarding our use of and their ability to correct that information. This policy applies to all personal information received by Syncano whether in electronic, paper, or verbal format.

<strong>Definitions</strong>

“Personal Information” means information that is (1) transferred from the EEA to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.

“Sensitive Personal Information” means information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual’s health.

<strong>Notice and Choice </strong>

Syncano does not collect Information from individuals directly. However, Information is received from affiliates or third-parties in the EEA for the purpose of providing technical support and maintenance. Syncano will use and disclose such information in accordance with the notices provided by such entities. If an individual opts-out when the data is collected by the affiliate or third-party in the EEA, Syncano has no means of receiving that individual’s Information.

<strong>Data Integrity</strong>

Syncano’s access to Information is limited due to the relationship between Syncano and its affiliates and third-parties. As such, Syncano does not have a direct impact on the integrity of the data it stores and cannot make any representations as to data integrity.

<strong>Onward Transfer</strong>

Syncano sometimes contracts with other companies to perform functions or services on our behalf. They may have access to Information needed to perform their functions, but are restricted from using Information for purposes other than providing services for us or to us. Syncano requires that its agents and service providers either certify with the Safe Harbor Program or enter into a written agreement with us that requires them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles.

<strong>Access and Correction</strong>

Due to the relationship between Syncano and its affiliates and third-parties, Syncano has only limited access to an individual’s data. As such, Syncano will forward any requests to access and correct an individual’s information to the appropriate affiliate or third-party.

<strong>Security </strong>

Syncano takes commercially reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Syncano has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure the Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, Syncano cannot guarantee the security of Information on or transmitted via the Internet.

<strong>U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor</strong>

Syncano complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Syncano has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Syncano’s certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/

<strong>Enforcement and Dispute Resolution </strong>

Syncano uses a third-party approach to assure compliance with this privacy policy and periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible and in conformity with the Principles.

In compliance with the US-EU Safe Harbor Principles, Syncano commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.  European Union citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Syncano using the information listed in the Contact Information section below.

Syncano has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
