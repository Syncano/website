<h2><b>3. The Official MBTA Commuter Rail App</b></h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5358" src="http://www.syncano.com/public/uploads/2014/07/070708commuterapp002.jpg" alt="real-time mbta app" width="960" height="540" /> This clean and simple <a href="http://www.keoliscs.com/mbta-commuter-rail-app/">real-time app</a> takes commuting to a new level in the Massachusetts Bay area. The app alerts you to possible delays, lets you know how much time you have until your train arrives, and then follows your train’s progress. If you’re inclined to naps on public transportation, the app also offers an alarm to wake you up before your stop. And, to help you keep track of your carbon footprint, you can check how much gas you’ve saved by riding the train.
<h2><b>4. Red Alert: Israel</b></h2>

It provides real-time alerts directly from military sources every time a rocket, mortar, or missile is fired, and has been dubbed by <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/an-actually-useful-version-of-yo-is-warning-israelis-of-rocket-strikes/">some</a> as an<em> "actually useful</em> version of Yo." Because users can click on alerts to leave comments, the app has turned into a kind of social network and public relations tool.
