It’s 7:00am. You just woke up and are getting your clothes on for your morning run. You grab your phone and put your headphones in so you can listen to the new running playlist you added to Spotify last night. On your way out, you realize - the playlist isn’t anywhere to be found. “<i>What? I swear I saw it yesterday and added it,”</i> you think. <!--more-->That's okay. You’ll listen to “Happy” again - no big deal.

When you’re ready to leave for work, you check the train times on your mobile app before you leave your apartment. Everything looks to be normal and on time. When you get to the station, you see a sign that the line you normally take is closed for construction. That's strange. You overhear an employee telling another traveler that they published the information on the website last night, but it didn’t update on the app. “<i>Great,”</i> you think, “<i>I’m going to be late to a meeting at work, but I’ll just e-mail my team and let them know.</i>”

You get to work, and your entire team is wondering where you’ve been. Turns out nobody received the email you sent - email hasn’t been working in real-time all day, and employees have been needing to hit the “refresh” button every hour to receive new emails. You sit down at your desk to see the problem for yourself and are alarmed that you have 35 unread messages. <i>“But wait, I already read all these on my phone last night,</i>” you think. “<i>The app on my phone mustn’t be syncing with the desktop email client. What a waste of time to have to go through these again.</i>”

Okay. These aren’t huge problems. You have bigger things to worry about, like presenting your latest app demo to your client. You open the file to make sure it’s ready for the presentation, but you find it’s missing all of the last minute changes your team made and saved on Dropbox. “<i>Hmm…</i>” you think, “<i>looks like the new version hasn’t synced.</i>” You would email your team to find out who has the latest version, but your email client isn’t working in real-time. So, you figure it’s faster to do it the old way – call all your team members individually and stop by one of their offices to grab the file on a USB drive.

All this has caused you to arrive late to the presentation. You’re worried at first, but after surveying the room it seems like everyone else has been having technology trouble this morning, too. One client's calendar didn’t sync with the invite and she actually didn’t even make the meeting! Whew.

After work, you planned to impress your new girlfriend with reservations at a restaurant she’s been dying to try. You arrive at the restaurant, but it looks like they’ve double booked your reservation. Turns out you made the reservation on the app and the other party made it on the website – but the data didn’t sync between devices or servers. “<i>Wow, what is going on?</i>” you think.

What a day. You’re glad at least you were able to calmly deal with all of the real-time sync obstacles, and although you didn’t get as much done as you wanted to, it’s not the end of the world. Sure, losing real-time sync didn’t ruin your life. But without it, you lost valuable time and convenience that modern day apps provide us. Real-time sync technology is what powers most apps we’ve come to rely on and allows our personal, social, and work lives to be seamlessly integrated. Even though we will survive without it, we won’t pave the way to the future unless we have it!
