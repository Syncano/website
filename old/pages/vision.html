  <h2>People are more connected to screens than ever before. In fact, there are an average of 5.7 internet connected devices per household, dramatically transforming the way we consume media, interact, engage and make decisions.</h2>
  <p>Not only are we using screens every day, but we are using them simultaneously for related or unrelated activities. How many times have you watched TV and used your smartphone or app during commercials?  Or have you ever started researching something on your phone and moved between your tablet and PC to aid in finalizing your decision?</p>
  <h3>This cross-screen behavior is now the new way we engage.</h3>
  <p>All of these screens that we use are powered by apps. As the app world has matured, so have consumer expectations. Consumers now expect relevant content and experiences to be delivered across their various devices in real time. Anything less takes away from a powerful user experience and misses the mark.</p>

  <p>Building smart, cross-screen apps takes significant time and effort. The challenge app developers have today is that the rate that apps are evolving is much faster than the time it takes to develop and scale them. The result of this challenge is that building these apps becomes cost prohibitive which can ultimately hinder innovation and the ability to get to market quickly.</p>
  <h3>This is where Syncano fits in.</h3>
