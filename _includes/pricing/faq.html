                        What happens if I exceed my usage? Can I set limits?

                        When you log into your Dashboard, you can set hard limits (absolute) and soft limits
                        (warnings/notifications issued). This ensures you are always in the loop when you have a sudden
                        burst in usage. If you actually exceed your usage, overage fees will appear on the next month’s
                        bill. You can change your limits at any time.

                        To understand a CodeBox execution, let’s look at CodeBox itself. CodeBox is a powerful Syncano tool
                        with multiple applications. You can use it to create integrations between third party services, to
                        create your own logic accessible by an API built on Webhooks, to run schedules, to create triggers
                        and more. CodeBox Executions are measured by webhooks, schedules or triggers. These are all
                        explained in detail <a href="http://docs.syncano.com/v4/docs/codebox-overview/" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        We understand that all apps come in different shapes and sizes. We recommend you start at the $25

                        following month.
