<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>What is Syncano?</h4>
<p>Syncano is scalable backend that helps developers build complex apps with only front-end code.
What it means is that you don't have to think about creating a scalable database for your project - we are taking care of that. And we are throwing in a cool set of features like real-time synchronization and access management on top of it!</p>
<h4>What services does Syncano provide?</h4>
<p>Syncano offers several tools that greatly simplify application development. Real-Time Synchronization allows your data to flow seamlessly across devices and servers in real-time, subscribe to notifications, and more. You can use our data storage to store your data temporarily or permanently. You can create and data structure using hierarchies and many to many relations thanks to our Data Modeling tools. Finally, you can decide who can access your data and differentiate user experiences via Permissions and User Management.</p>
<h4>How can I move my data off Syncano?</h4>
<p>We are currently working very hard on implementing a new concept that will allow exporting/importing full instances with their structure and data and share it between the users. As for now, you can simply make get() requests on the data you'd like to move. We store the data in json format so it should be fairly easy to export it to a different platform if needed.</p>
